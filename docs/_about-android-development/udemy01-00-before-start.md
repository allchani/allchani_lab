#### 1. Debug Your Code
- Check for error messages
- remove all the code you just added until it works again, and then add it in line by line
- compare your code against my demo code - see what is different and see if that is causing the problem

#### 2. Find Solutins Online
- Google the specific error message, along with the name of the programming lagnuage
- Google 'how do I...'

#### 3.Ask Good Questions
- Be positive!
- Be specific - give the few lines of code that are causing the problem (not a massive code dump!)
- If possible, give a link to your code in action, either on your web hosting or on jsbin.com or another site
- Thank someone if they've helped you
- While you are there, answer someone else's questions
