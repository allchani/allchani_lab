# What's this course all about?

## Welcome
- about A/B testing
- example : marketing, retail, newsfeed algorithms, online advertising, etc.
- It's all about comparing things
- __Prove__ it with numbers

## A/B Testing Outline
1. Probability review and exercises
2. Traditional A/B Testing
3. Adaptive methods(epsilon-greedy from reinforcement learning, Explore-exploit dilemma, UCB1)
4. Full Bayesian method

## Bayesian Methods
- An entirely different way of thinking about probability
- A paradigm shift
- REVIEW the course several times before it "sinks in"
- Many experts "subscribe to the Bayesian school of thought"
- Powerful new tools to apply in machine learning
- A/B testing is just an example
- But will allow us to develop a method that can be applied in later courses

# BE HANDS-ON!!!
- Try writing all the code yourself
- Machine learning code is special because you need to understand all the theory behind it
- So make sure you can understand and write out all the derivations independently
- Do the exercises
