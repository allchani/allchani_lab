# Bayes Rule & Probability Review

$$p(A|B)=p(A,B)/p(B)$$  


- $p(A|B)$ - conditional
- $p(A,B)$ - joint
- $p(B)$ - marginal

# Bayes Example

A = {Buys, Does Not Buy}, B = {USA, Canada, Mexico}  
Suppose we want to find p(Buy? | Country)

|                           | CA  | US  | MX  |
|:-------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| __Buy = 1(did buy)__      |20   |50   |10   |
| __Buy = 0(did not buy)__  |300  |500  |200  |

- let's find p(Country) first
    + p(Country=Mexico) = 210 / (210+550+320) = 0.19
    + p(Country=US) = 550 / (210+550+320) = 0.51
    + p(Country=Canada) = 320 / (210+550+320) = 0.30
- Joint probabilities
    + p(Buy=1, Country=CA) = 0.019
    + p(Buy=0, Country=CA) = 0.28
    + p(Buy=1, Country=US) = 0.046
    + p(Buy=0, Country=US) = 0.46
    + p(Buy=1, Country=MX) = 0.0093
    + p(Buy=0, Country=MX) = 0.19
- Curse of dimensionality is a bad thing,
- Because as the volume grows:
- We need to do more computation
- Need more samples to get accurate estimates

- These seem a lot smaller than the marginals p(Country) we calculated earlier
- Sum of all possible outcomes must = 1
- If number of total possibilities grows exponentially, actual probability values will shrink exponontially
- Another consequence of "curse of simensionality"
- Computers have finite precision - 32-bit float holds 32-bits of info
- Can't store infinite number of values


- Underflow
    - As probability â†’ 0, eventually computer will round down to 0
    - Called the "Underflow" problem
    - Common in probability - use the log probability instead
    - Log grows slowly as its argument increases
